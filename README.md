#Automailer

Built originally to quickly send the same test mail to a group of freshly set up emails this can be used to send the same email to as many people as you like. Certainly something anyone can whip up in five minutes but may answer some ones prayers.

#Destructions:
Populate "email_list.txt" with the list of desired emails like so:
```
tim@domain.com
george@domain.com
ted@domain.com
```
The message is currently passed as a parameter be it test or the output of a script.

The subject is set in the mail.sh script.

#ToDos:
I dont expect to work on this any further but if I did...

Make subject and message optionally get read from command line when the script is run. Will need to add some flags with optargs..
